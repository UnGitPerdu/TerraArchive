*********WORK IN PROGRESS********
VERSION 0.1


*WORK IN PROGRESS**
!!! We're currently asking for volunteers to help with the mod, the development progress has been slow and at this state it is not finishing anytime soon. Dm me if you are interested in helping, i am willing to make the mod open source if needed.

The current steam version of the mod is a place holder version, the mod is techniqually not released
This mod might not get update and could be deleted when we publish the first version of official Blue Archive x Terraria mod, the mod development is sloppy due to most of us are working full time, but it is being worked on, stay tune

Blue Archive x Terraria (code name: TerraArchive)
The mod is not actually released yet on steam, it's a sprite and upload test, the few armor and weapons are locked with no recipe, you can get them through cheat menu but in current state they are nothing special.
!!! It is advised to ðŸš« NOTðŸš«  use vanity with other mods, as student's sprites are shorter and more skinny compare to vanilla !!!

The NPCs and Bosses are currently locked, you can not acquire them in this version yet
